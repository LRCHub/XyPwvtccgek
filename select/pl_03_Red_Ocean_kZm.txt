Why are you haunting me
Making me repeat your mistakes
You know I'll do whatever it
takes
To control my destiny
I know you think I failed
Although I've done no wrong
A different life I had planned
A life I wanted for so long
Don`t say the lies that you've
already said
Don`t kill the light that is
already dead
To God my message I will send
Don't give me hope that doesn't
exist
Don't tell me to quit and stop
to resist
Tonight my misery comes to an
end
A drop of blood in the ocean
Colored the water red
A life full of emotions
Because of you is dead
And while I'm leaving you
I will lock my heart in the cell
And I blame you for everything
For this you'll burn in hell
